            <p>Sophie Mary Wilson CBE FRS FREng(born 1957) is a British computer scientist. She is currently serving
                as a director at the technology conglomerate Broadcom Inc.[6] Wilson designed a processor type that
                became one of the most successful IP cores, and by 2012 was being used in 95% of smartphones. Wilson
                was listed in 2011 in Maximum PC as number 8 in an article titled The 15 Most Important Women in Tech
                History.
            </p>
            <p>In 1978, she joined Acorn Computers Ltd, after designing a device to prevent cigarette lighter sparks
                triggering payouts on fruit machines.[7] Her computer design was used by Chris Curry and Hermann Hauser
                to build the Acorn Micro-Computer, the first of a long line of computers sold by the company.
            </p>
            <p> In July 1981, Wilson extended the Acorn Atom's BASIC programming language dialect into an improved
                version for the Acorn Proton, a microcomputer that enabled Acorn to win the contract with the British
                Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) for their ambitious computer education project.[11] Hauser played a
                mental game where he told both Wilson and colleague Steve Furber that the other had agreed a prototype
                could be built within a week. Agreeing to the challenge, she designed the system including the circuit
                board and components from Monday to Wednesday, which required fast new DRAM integrated circuits to be
                sourced directly from Hitachi. By Thursday evening, a prototype had been built, but the software had
                bugs, requiring her to stay up all night and into Friday debugging. Wilson recalled watching the wedding
                of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer on a small portable television while attempting to debug and
                re-solder the prototype. It was a success with the BBC, who awarded Acorn the contract. Along with
                Furber, Wilson was present backstage at the machine's first airing on television, in case any software
                fixes were required. She later described the event as "a unique moment in time when the public wanted to
                know how this stuff works and could be shown and taught how to program."[12] The Proton became the BBC
                Micro and its BASIC evolved into BBC BASIC, whose development was led by Wilson for the next 15 years.
                As well as programming, she wrote the manuals and technical specifications, realising communication was
                an important part of being successful.
            </p>
            <p>In October 1983, Wilson began designing the instruction set for one of the first reduced instruction set
                computer (RISC) processors, the Acorn RISC Machine (ARM),[13] The ARM1 was delivered on 26 April 1985
                and worked first time.[14] This processor type was later to become one of the most successful IP cores —
                a licensed CPU core — and by 2012 was being used in 95% of smartphones.[7]
            </p>
            <p> Wilson designed Acorn Replay, the video architecture for Acorn machines. This included the operating
                system extensions for video access, as well as the codecs, optimized to run high frame rate video on ARM
                CPUs from the ARM 2 onwards.
            </p>
            <p>She was a member of the board of the technology and games company Eidos Interactive, which bought and
                created Eidos Interactive, for the years following its flotation in 1990, and was a consultant to ARM
                Ltd when it was split off from Acorn in 1990.
            </p>
            <p> Wilson giving a public presentation on ARM development in 2009
                Since the demise of Acorn Computers, Wilson has made a small number of public appearances to talk about
                work done there.[15]
            </p>
            <p> She is now the Director of IC Design in Broadcom's Cambridge, UK office.[6] She was the Chief Architect
                of Broadcom's Firepath processor.[16] Firepath has its history in Acorn Computers, which, after being
                renamed to Element 14, was bought by Broadcom in 2000.
            </p>
            <p>She was listed in 2011 in Maximum PC as number 8 in an article titled The 15 Most Important Women in
                Tech History.[8]She was awarded the Fellow Award by the Computer History Museum in California in 2012
                "for her work, with Steve Furber, on the BBC Micro computer and the ARM processor
                architecture."[17][18][19][20] In 2013 Wilson was elected as a Fellow of the prestigious Royal
                Society.[21] She received the 2014 Lovie Lifetime Achievement Award in acknowledgement for her
                significant invention of the ARM processor.[22]
            </p>
            <p>Wilson was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2019 Birthday Honours for
                services to computing.[23]
