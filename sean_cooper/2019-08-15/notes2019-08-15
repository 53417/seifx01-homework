JAVASCRIPT NOTES

//var city = 'Sydney';

//use let only if u think the variable will change/get overwritten
let city = 'Sydney'; 

//use const if no change - immutable data
//favour const over let??
const firstName = 'Sean';


string = set of characters that are enclosed with single quotes or double quotes or backticks
- single quote recommended\

console.log()
- prints stuff out inc variables

numbers = dont need to parse numbers due to text vs values

Boolean = true or fales (primitive data)
- true and false are reserved words, they dont need to be parsed

Undefined = this variable has not been initialised
- most languages dont have this (makes laggy)

Null = similar to undefined 
- has not been answered

maintainance tips
- dont let variables be a b c d e
- people dont like 
- always make effort to make name for variable
- do not use reserved words
- use camelCase or snake_case only

concatenate: let = "text1" + "text2"

EXERCISE: Fortune teller 
myway:
let number_of_children = 100;

let partners_name = 'Anon';

let geographic_location = 'USA';

let job_title = 'shoeguy';

//Concatenation is aids
const fortune_scam = "you will be a " + job_title + " in " + geographic_location + ", and married to " + partners_name + " with " + number_of_children + " kids.";

//String interpolation is better
const fortune_scam_v2 = `You will be a ${job_title} in ${geographic_location} and married to ${partners_name} with ${number_of_children} kids.`;

console.log(fortune_scam_v2);

Arithmetic operation
- can use + - * /
- shits the same as RL and excel: * / goes first over + -

split ur parenthesis shit
eg:
const price = 21 + 3;
const cookies_wanted = 7
const total = price / cookies_wanted


EXERCISE: The age calculator

let current_year = 2019;
const birth_year = 1990;

const possible_age = current_year - birth_year;
const their_age = `They are either ${possible_age - 1} or ${possible_age}.`;

console.log(their_age);

EXERCISE: the lifetime supply calculator

let current_age = 22;
const max_age = 40;
const snack_required_per_day = 20;

const rem_living_years = max_age - current_age;

const snack_till_death = `You will need roughly ${rem_living_years * snack_required_per_day * 365} units of snack to last until the ripe old age of ${max_age}.`

console.log(snack_till_death);

(should have 365 as a const days_in_year so can maintain AKA NO MAGIC NUMBERS)

JS is (for now) a loosely typed language

COMMENTS:
/* multi line content */
// single line content
- if u have to do a comment - you most likely can make the var name better
- dont do comments as much since people may change ur code


FUNCTIONS: 

EXERCISE: calculating circles
let circleR = 4;

//can also use Math.PI
let piValue = 3.141592;

/*Circumference of Circle = PI x diameter = 2 PI x radius
    where PI = PI = 3.141592...
    */
const calculateCircumference = function (radius) {
  let result = radius * 2 * piValue;
  return result;
};

/* Area of Circle:
    area = PI r2
    */

const calculateArea = function (radius) {
  let result = radius * radius * piValue;
  return result;
};

const result = `The circumference is ${calculateCircumference(circleR)} and The area is ${calculateArea(circleR)}.`;

console.log(result);
